## Why?

I am a web developer since around 2020 and have created several full stack web applications using
multiple languages and frameworks. Therefore, I am fairly familiar with the HTTP protocol, but I
never tried implementing it myself and only used HTTP libraries.

Therefore this is a little educational project to implement a simple HTTP/1.1 file server. Feel
free to use it as inspiration or reference point for your own implementation journey.
